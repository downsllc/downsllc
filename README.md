### Digital Forensics • Investigations • Evidence Integrity

I am the founder of **Octo Digital Forensics**, providing digital investigations, evidence analysis, and court-ready reporting for legal, civil, and private matters.

I also serve as **Marketing Director** at **WeTreat** and **National Medical Directors**, where I lead growth strategy, systems architecture, and compliance-driven marketing for healthcare organizations.

My work emphasizes **clarity, defensibility, and precision** — whether analyzing digital evidence or building high-stakes systems.
